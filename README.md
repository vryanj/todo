#TODO API

Setup a project with your programming language of choice and create an API for managing a TODO list with the following specification:

##Register
The user should be able to register with a username and password
Usernames must be unique across all users

##Login
The user should be able to log in with the credentials they provided in the register endpoint
Should return an access token that can be used for the other endpoints

##TODO List
-The user should only be able to access their own tasks
-The user should be able to list all tasks in the TODO list
-The user should be able to add a task to the TODO list
-The user should be able to update the details of a task in their TODO list
-The user should be able to remove a task from the TODO list
-The user should be able to reorder the tasks in the TODO list
-A task in the TODO list should be able to handle being moved more than 50 times
-A task in the TODO list should be able to handle being moved to more than one task away from its current position

**Return proper errors with corresponding HTTP codes**

**Note:** You can think of this as an API endpoint that will be used to handle the drag and drop feature of a TODO list application.

All endpoints should return JSON responses.
